# What?

This repo will contain experiments related with code and other stuff (maybe music compositions or whatever I could consider interesting).
It is intended to be a repository where you can find some very small personal projects.

# Why?
My intention is share this stuff with you.  May be you can benefit from what I learned of each one of them.
